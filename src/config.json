IE\n has a bug (it's not RFC 2617 compliant) in that it will use the basic\n scheme if basic is the first entry presented, even if more secure\n schemes are presented. For now use the order in the recommended\n settings section below. If other browsers have difficulties (don't\n recognize the schemes offered even if you are using basic) either\n put basic first, or disable the other schemes (by commenting out their\n program entry).\n \n Once an authentication scheme is fully configured, it can only be\n shutdown by shutting squid down and restarting. Changes can be made on\n the fly and activated with a reconfigure. I.E. You can change to a\n different helper, but not unconfigure the helper completely.\n \n Please note that while this directive defines how Squid processes\n authentication it does not automatically activate authentication.\n To use authentication you must in addition make use of ACLs based\n on login name in http_access (proxy_auth, proxy_auth_regex or\n external with %LOGIN used in the format tag). The browser will be\n challenged for authentication on the first such acl encountered\n in http_access processing and will also be re-challenged for new\n login credentials if the request is being denied by a proxy_auth\n type acl.\n \n WARNING: authentication can't be used in a transparently intercepting\n proxy as the client then thinks it is talking to an origin server and\n not the proxy. This is a limitation of bending the TCP/IP protocol to\n transparently intercepting port 80, not a limitation in Squid.\n Ports flagged 'transparent', 'intercept', or 'tproxy' have\n authentication disabled.\n \n === Parameters common to all schemes. ===\n \n \"program\" cmdline\n Specifies the command for the external authenticator.\n \n By default, each authentication scheme is not used unless a\n program is specified.\n \n See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/AddonHelpers for\n more details on helper operations and creating your own.\n \n \"key_extras\" format\n Specifies a string to be append to request line format for\n the authentication helper. \"Quoted\" format values may contain\n spaces and logformat %macros. In theory, any logformat %macro\n can be used. In practice, a %macro expands as a dash (-) if\n the helper request is sent before the required macro\n information is available to Squid.\n \n By default, Squid uses request formats provided in\n scheme-specific examples below (search for %credentials).\n \n The expanded key_extras value is added to the Squid credentials\n cache and, hence, will affect authentication. It can be used to\n autenticate different users with identical user names (e.g.,\n when user authentication depends on http_port).\n \n Avoid adding frequently changing information to key_extras. For\n example, if you add user source IP, and it changes frequently\n in your environment, then max_user_ip ACL is going to treat\n every user+IP combination as a unique \"user\", breaking the ACL\n and wasting a lot of memory on those user records. It will also\n force users to authenticate from scratch whenever their IP\n changes.\n \n \"realm\" string\n Specifies the protection scope (aka realm name) which is to be\n reported to the client for the authentication scheme. It is\n commonly part of the text the user will see when prompted for\n their username and password.\n \n For Basic the default is \"Squid proxy-caching web server\".\n For Digest there is no default, this parameter is mandatory.\n For NTLM and Negotiate this parameter is ignored.\n \n \"children\" numberofchildren [startup=N] [idle=N] [concurrency=N]\n \n The maximum number of authenticator processes to spawn. If\n you start too few Squid will have to wait for them to process\n a backlog of credential verifications, slowing it down. When\n password verifications are done via a (slow) network you are\n likely to need lots of authenticator processes.\n \n The startup= and idle= options permit some skew in the exact\n amount run. A minimum of startup=N will begin during startup\n and reconfigure. Squid will start more in groups of up to\n idle=N in an attempt to meet traffic needs and to keep idle=N\n free above those traffic needs up to the maximum.\n \n The concurrency= option sets the number of concurrent requests\n the helper can process.  The default of 0 is used for helpers\n who only supports one request at a time. Setting this to a\n number greater than 0 changes the protocol used to include a\n channel ID field first on the request/response line, allowing\n multiple requests to be sent to the same helper in parallel\n without waiting for the response.\n \n Concurrency must not be set unless it's known the helper\n supports the input format with channel-ID fields.\n \n NOTE: NTLM and Negotiate schemes do not support concurrency\n in the Squid code module even though some helpers can.\n \n \n \n === Example Configuration ===\n \n This configuration displays the recommended authentication scheme\n order from most to least secure with recommended minimum configuration\n settings for each scheme:\n \n  auth_param negotiate program <uncomment and complete this line to activate>\n  auth_param negotiate children 20 startup=0 idle=1\n  auth_param negotiate keep_alive on\n  \n  auth_param digest program <uncomment and complete this line to activate>\n  auth_param digest children 20 startup=0 idle=1\n  auth_param digest realm Squid proxy-caching web server\n  auth_param digest nonce_garbage_interval 5 minutes\n  auth_param digest nonce_max_duration 30 minutes\n  auth_param digest nonce_max_count 50\n  \n  auth_param ntlm program <uncomment and complete this line to activate>\n  auth_param ntlm children 20 startup=0 idle=1\n  auth_param ntlm keep_alive on\n  \n  auth_param basic program <uncomment and complete this line>\n  auth_param basic children 5 startup=5 idle=1\n  auth_param basic realm Squid proxy-caching web server\n  auth_param basic credentialsttl 2 hours\n Default:\n  none\n", "   TAG: authenticate_cache_garbage_interval\n The time period between garbage collection across the username cache.\n This is a trade-off between memory utilization (long intervals - say\n 2 days) and CPU (short intervals - say 1 minute).

Some Squid modules (e.g., caching) do not\n currently work with native FTP proxying, and many features have not\n even been tested for compatibility. Test well before deploying!\n \n Native FTP proxying differs substantially from proxying HTTP requests\n with ftp:// URIs because Squid works as an FTP server and receives\n actual FTP commands (rather than HTTP requests with FTP URLs).\n \n Native FTP commands accepted at ftp_port are internally converted or\n wrapped into HTTP-like messages. The same happens to Native FTP\n responses received from FTP origin servers. Those HTTP-like messages\n are shoveled through regular access control and adaptation layers\n between the FTP client and the FTP origin server. This allows Squid to\n examine, adapt, block, and log FTP exchanges. Squid reuses most HTTP\n mechanisms when shoveling wrapped FTP messages. For example,\n http_access and adaptation_access directives are used.\n \n Modes:\n \n    interceptSame as http_port intercept.

Standby connection failures\n count towards this limit. Default is 10.\n \n allow-missDisable Squid's use of only-if-cached when forwarding\n requests to siblings. This is primarily useful when\n icp_hit_stale is used by the sibling. Excessive use\n of this option may result in forwarding loops. One way\n to prevent peering loops when using this option, is to\n deny cache peer usage on requests from a peer:\n acl fromPeer ...\n cache_peer_access peerName deny fromPeer\n \n max-conn=N Limit the number of concurrent connections the Squid\n may open to this peer, including already opened idle\n and standby connections. There is no peer-specific\n connection limit by default.\n \n A peer exceeding the limit is not used for new\n requests unless a standby connection is available.\n \n max-conn currently works poorly with idle persistent\n connections: When a peer reaches its max-conn limit,\n and there are idle persistent connections to the peer,\n the peer may not be selected because the limiting code\n does not know whether Squid can reuse those idle\n connections.\n \n standby=NMaintain a pool of N \"hot standby\" connections to an\n UP peer, available for requests when no idle\n persistent connection is available (or safe) to use.\n By default and with zero N, no such pool is maintained.\n N must not exceed the max-conn limit (if any).\n \n At start or after reconfiguration, Squid opens new TCP\n standby connections until there are N connections\n available and then replenishes the standby pool as\n opened connections are used up for requests. A used\n connection never goes back to the standby pool, but\n may go to the regular idle persistent connection pool\n shared by all peers and origin servers.\n \n Squid never opens multiple new standby connections\n concurrently.  This one-at-a-time approach minimizes\n flooding-like effect on peers. Furthermore, just a few\n standby connections should be sufficient in most cases\n to supply most new requests with a ready-to-use\n connection.\n \n Standby connections obey server_idle_pconn_timeout.\n For the feature to work as intended, the peer must be\n configured to accept and keep them open longer than\n the idle timeout at the connecting Squid, to minimize\n race conditions typical to idle used persistent\n connections. Default request_timeout and\n server_idle_pconn_timeout values ensure such a\n configuration.\n \n name=xxxUnique name for the peer.\n Required if you have multiple peers on the same host\n but different ports.\n This name can be used in cache_peer_access and similar\n directives to identify the peer.\n Can be used by outgoing access controls through the\n peername ACL type.\n \n no-tproxyDo not use the client-spoof TPROXY support when forwarding\n requests to this peer.

Ignored when using blocking I/O module because\n blocking synchronous I/O does not allow Squid to estimate the\n expected swap wait time.\n \n max-swap-rate=swaps/sec: Artificially limits disk access using\n the specified I/O rate limit. Swap out requests that\n would cause the average I/O rate to exceed the limit are\n delayed. Individual swap in requests (i.e., hits or reads) are\n not delayed, but they do contribute to measured swap rate and\n since they are placed in the same FIFO queue as swap out\n requests, they may wait longer if max-swap-rate is smaller.\n This is necessary on file systems that buffer \"too\n many\" writes and then start blocking Squid and other processes\n while committing those writes to disk.  Usually used together\n with swap-timeout to avoid excessive delays and queue overflows\n when disk demand exceeds available disk \"bandwidth\". By default\n and when set to zero, disables the disk I/O rate limit\n enforcement. Currently supported by IpcIo module only.\n \n slot-size=bytes: The size of a database \"record\" used for\n storing cached responses. A cached response occupies at least\n one slot and all database I/O is done using individual slots so\n increasing this parameter leads to more disk space waste while\n decreasing it leads to more disk I/O overheads. Should be a\n multiple of your operating system I/O page size. Defaults to\n 16KBytes. A housekeeping header is stored with each slot and\n smaller slot-sizes will be rejected.

So space used to store objects and data throughput\n may be very unbalanced towards larger disks.\n \n \n round-robin\n \n This algorithm is suited to caches with unequal cache_dir\n disk sizes.\n \n Each cache_dir is selected in a rotation. The next suitable\n cache_dir is used.\n \n Available cache_dir capacity is only considered in relation\n to whether the object will fit and meets the min-size and\n max-size parameters.\n \n Disk I/O loading is only considered to prevent overload on slow\n disks. This algorithm does not spread objects by size, so any\n I/O loading per-disk may appear very unbalanced and volatile.\n \n If several cache_dirs use similar min-size, max-size, or other\n limits to to reject certain responses, then do not group such\n cache_dir lines together, to avoid round-robin selection bias\n towards the first cache_dir after the group.
