IE\n\thas a bug (it's not RFC 2617 compliant) in that it will use the basic\n\tscheme if basic is the first entry presented, even if more secure\n\tschemes are presented. For now use the order in the recommended\n\tsettings section below. If other browsers have difficulties (don't\n\trecognize the schemes offered even if you are using basic) either\n\tput basic first, or disable the other schemes (by commenting out their\n\tprogram entry).\n\n\tOnce an authentication scheme is fully configured, it can only be\n\tshutdown by shutting squid down and restarting. Changes can be made on\n\tthe fly and activated with a reconfigure. I.E. You can change to a\n\tdifferent helper, but not unconfigure the helper completely.\n\n\tPlease note that while this directive defines how Squid processes\n\tauthentication it does not automatically activate authentication.\n\tTo use authentication you must in addition make use of ACLs based\n\ton login name in http_access (proxy_auth, proxy_auth_regex or\n\texternal with %LOGIN used in the format tag). The browser will be\n\tchallenged for authentication on the first such acl encountered\n\tin http_access processing and will also be re-challenged for new\n\tlogin credentials if the request is being denied by a proxy_auth\n\ttype acl.\n\n\tWARNING: authentication can't be used in a transparently intercepting\n\tproxy as the client then thinks it is talking to an origin server and\n\tnot the proxy. This is a limitation of bending the TCP/IP protocol to\n\ttransparently intercepting port 80, not a limitation in Squid.\n\tPorts flagged 'transparent', 'intercept', or 'tproxy' have\n\tauthentication disabled.\n\n\t=== Parameters common to all schemes. ===\n\n\t\"program\" cmdline\n\t\tSpecifies the command for the external authenticator.\n\n\t\tBy default, each authentication scheme is not used unless a\n\t\tprogram is specified.\n\n\t\tSee http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/AddonHelpers for\n\t\tmore details on helper operations and creating your own.\n\n\t\"key_extras\" format\n\t\tSpecifies a string to be append to request line format for\n\t\tthe authentication helper. \"Quoted\" format values may contain\n\t\tspaces and logformat %macros. In theory, any logformat %macro\n\t\tcan be used. In practice, a %macro expands as a dash (-) if\n\t\tthe helper request is sent before the required macro\n\t\tinformation is available to Squid.\n\n\t\tBy default, Squid uses request formats provided in\n\t\tscheme-specific examples below (search for %credentials).\n\n\t\tThe expanded key_extras value is added to the Squid credentials\n\t\tcache and, hence, will affect authentication. It can be used to\n\t\tautenticate different users with identical user names (e.g.,\n\t\twhen user authentication depends on http_port).\n\n\t\tAvoid adding frequently changing information to key_extras. For\n\t\texample, if you add user source IP, and it changes frequently\n\t\tin your environment, then max_user_ip ACL is going to treat\n\t\tevery user+IP combination as a unique \"user\", breaking the ACL\n\t\tand wasting a lot of memory on those user records. It will also\n\t\tforce users to authenticate from scratch whenever their IP\n\t\tchanges.\n\n\t\"realm\" string\n\t\tSpecifies the protection scope (aka realm name) which is to be\n\t\treported to the client for the authentication scheme. It is\n\t\tcommonly part of the text the user will see when prompted for\n\t\ttheir username and password.\n\n\t\tFor Basic the default is \"Squid proxy-caching web server\".\n\t\tFor Digest there is no default, this parameter is mandatory.\n\t\tFor NTLM and Negotiate this parameter is ignored.\n\n\t\"children\" numberofchildren [startup=N] [idle=N] [concurrency=N]\n\n\t\tThe maximum number of authenticator processes to spawn. If\n\t\tyou start too few Squid will have to wait for them to process\n\t\ta backlog of credential verifications, slowing it down. When\n\t\tpassword verifications are done via a (slow) network you are\n\t\tlikely to need lots of authenticator processes.\n\n\t\tThe startup= and idle= options permit some skew in the exact\n\t\tamount run. A minimum of startup=N will begin during startup\n\t\tand reconfigure. Squid will start more in groups of up to\n\t\tidle=N in an attempt to meet traffic needs and to keep idle=N\n\t\tfree above those traffic needs up to the maximum.\n\n\t\tThe concurrency= option sets the number of concurrent requests\n\t\tthe helper can process.  The default of 0 is used for helpers\n\t\twho only supports one request at a time. Setting this to a\n\t\tnumber greater than 0 changes the protocol used to include a\n\t\tchannel ID field first on the request/response line, allowing\n\t\tmultiple requests to be sent to the same helper in parallel\n\t\twithout waiting for the response.\n\n\t\tConcurrency must not be set unless it's known the helper\n\t\tsupports the input format with channel-ID fields.\n\n\t\tNOTE: NTLM and Negotiate schemes do not support concurrency\n\t\t\tin the Squid code module even though some helpers can.\n\n\n\n\t=== Example Configuration ===\n\n\tThis configuration displays the recommended authentication scheme\n\torder from most to least secure with recommended minimum configuration\n\tsettings for each scheme:\n\nauth_param negotiate program <uncomment and complete this line to activate>\nauth_param negotiate children 20 startup=0 idle=1\nauth_param negotiate keep_alive on\n\nauth_param digest program <uncomment and complete this line to activate>\nauth_param digest children 20 startup=0 idle=1\nauth_param digest realm Squid proxy-caching web server\nauth_param digest nonce_garbage_interval 5 minutes\nauth_param digest nonce_max_duration 30 minutes\nauth_param digest nonce_max_count 50\n\nauth_param ntlm program <uncomment and complete this line to activate>\nauth_param ntlm children 20 startup=0 idle=1\nauth_param ntlm keep_alive on\n\nauth_param basic program <uncomment and complete this line>\nauth_param basic children 5 startup=5 idle=1\nauth_param basic realm Squid proxy-caching web server\nauth_param basic credentialsttl 2 hours\nDefault:\n none\n", "\tThe time period between garbage collection across the username cache.\n\tThis is a trade-off between memory utilization (long intervals - say\n\t2 days) and CPU (short intervals - say 1 minute).

Some Squid modules (e.g., caching) do not\n\tcurrently work with native FTP proxying, and many features have not\n\teven been tested for compatibility. Test well before deploying!\n\n\tNative FTP proxying differs substantially from proxying HTTP requests\n\twith ftp:// URIs because Squid works as an FTP server and receives\n\tactual FTP commands (rather than HTTP requests with FTP URLs).\n\n\tNative FTP commands accepted at ftp_port are internally converted or\n\twrapped into HTTP-like messages. The same happens to Native FTP\n\tresponses received from FTP origin servers. Those HTTP-like messages\n\tare shoveled through regular access control and adaptation layers\n\tbetween the FTP client and the FTP origin server. This allows Squid to\n\texamine, adapt, block, and log FTP exchanges. Squid reuses most HTTP\n\tmechanisms when shoveling wrapped FTP messages. For example,\n\thttp_access and adaptation_access directives are used.\n\n\tModes:\n\n\t   intercept\tSame as http_port intercept.
